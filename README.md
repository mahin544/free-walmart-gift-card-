Why Walmart Gift Cards Are So Valuable

Walmart gift cards are versatile and can be used to purchase almost anything available in their stores or online. Whether you need essentials like food and toiletries or want to splurge on a gadget or toy, a Walmart gift card has you covered. Additionally, these gift cards never expire, making them an excellent option for long-term savings or gifting.

1. Participate in Online Surveys

One of the easiest ways to earn free Walmart gift cards is by participating in online surveys. Many market research companies reward participants with gift cards for sharing their opinions on products and services. Here are a few trusted platforms:

Swagbucks: Earn points by completing surveys, watching videos, or shopping online. Points can be redeemed for Walmart gift cards.

Survey Junkie: Share your opinions and get rewarded with gift cards or PayPal cash.

InboxDollars: Complete surveys, play games, or watch ads to earn credits that can be exchanged for Walmart gift cards.

While this method may not make you rich, it’s a simple and reliable way to accumulate rewards during your free time.

2. Cashback Apps and Extensions

Cashback apps and browser extensions make it easy to earn rewards while shopping online or in-store. Some top-rated apps include:

Rakuten: Shop through their platform or use their browser extension to earn cashback on purchases. The cashback can be converted into Walmart gift cards.

Ibotta: Upload your Walmart receipts to earn cashback on eligible items, which can be redeemed for gift cards.

Fetch Rewards: Scan any receipt to earn points that can be exchanged for Walmart gift cards.

These apps not only help you save money but also provide a hassle-free way to earn rewards.

3. Sign Up for Rewards Programs

Many companies offer rewards programs that include Walmart gift cards as redemption options. Consider these programs:

Microsoft Rewards: Earn points by using Microsoft products or Bing for searches. Redeem points for Walmart gift cards.

Kellogg’s Family Rewards: Collect codes from Kellogg’s products and redeem them for gift cards.

Shopkick: Earn “kicks” by walking into stores, scanning products, or making purchases. Exchange kicks for Walmart gift cards.

4. Enter Giveaways and Contests

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter often host giveaways and contests with Walmart gift cards as prizes. Follow reputable brands, influencers, and contest pages to stay updated. While there’s no guarantee of winning, participating in multiple giveaways increases your chances.

5. Credit Card Rewards

Certain credit cards offer reward points that can be converted into gift cards. If you’re already using a rewards credit card, check if Walmart gift cards are an option. Some cards even offer bonus points for shopping at Walmart, making it easier to accumulate rewards.

6. Referral Programs

Many platforms and services offer referral bonuses in the form of gift cards. Share your unique referral link with friends and family, and earn rewards when they sign up or make a purchase. Examples include:

Swagbucks: Earn bonus points for every friend who signs up using your referral link.

Ibotta: Get rewarded when your friends join and redeem offers.

7. Trade-In Programs

Walmart’s own trade-in program allows you to exchange old electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and video game consoles, for Walmart eGift cards. Simply visit their trade-in portal, get an estimate, and ship your items for free. Once your trade-in is processed, you’ll receive your gift card.

8. Use Walmart’s Savings Catcher (Discontinued but Worth Mentioning)

Although Walmart’s Savings Catcher program is no longer active, it’s worth mentioning for historical context. The program allowed shoppers to submit their receipts for a price match, and any savings were credited to a Walmart eGift card. While it’s no longer available, other tools and apps can help you achieve similar savings.

9. Mystery Shopping

Mystery shopping involves evaluating customer service and store operations for retailers. Companies like Market Force Information often hire mystery shoppers and compensate them with gift cards, including Walmart gift cards. If you enjoy shopping and providing feedback, this could be a fun and rewarding option.

10. Earning Through Apps and Games

Some mobile apps and games reward users with points or credits that can be exchanged for gift cards. Examples include:

Mistplay: Play mobile games and earn points to redeem for gift cards.

Lucktastic: Enter sweepstakes and scratch card games for a chance to win gift cards.

Avoid Scams

While there are legitimate ways to earn free Walmart gift cards, beware of scams. Avoid websites or offers that require payment upfront or ask for sensitive personal information. Always verify the legitimacy of a platform before sharing your details.

Final Thoughts

Earning a free Walmart gift card is entirely possible with a little effort and consistency. Whether you prefer taking surveys, using cashback apps, or participating in rewards programs, there’s a method for everyone. By combining multiple strategies, you can maximize your earnings and enjoy the benefits of free Walmart shopping.
